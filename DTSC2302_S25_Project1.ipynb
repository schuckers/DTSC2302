    "For this assignment, you’ll work in groups of approximately four.  You’ll turn in this assignment via Gradescope.  You may NOT use generative AI for this project.  When you submit your report, start each Part on a new page.  For each of the parts below, support your answers with evidence.  Your audience is a statistically knowledge boss who understands modelling broadly but is busy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis you will write a report which will focus on the implications of the model with a small amount of emphasis on the modelling process.   Be sure to specify any new features you created.  Put supportive model output in an Appendix for each Part below.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Part A.\n",
    "Using the data in [<https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mschuck1/classes/DTSC2301/Data/proj_sladult-census-numeric-all.csv>], create the best classification model based upon cross-validation from among logistic, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees and support vector classifiers for predicting the variable salaryclass which takes values “<=50k” or “>50k” in salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce the data to your audience in a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a single paragraph report on your comparisons between the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a single visualization to compare the performance of your models, label and reference that visualization and explain it to your reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choose the model you would suggest that your organization use for prediction, explain your reasoning and give a description of that model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make predictions for an individual who is 39 years old, with 10 years of education, 0 capital gains, 0 capital losses and works 40 hours per week as well as for an individual who is 45 years old, with 14 years of education, 2000 capital gains, 0 capital losses and works 35 hours per week.  Write up your predictions as a paragraph and \n",

    "The variables in these data are:\n",
    "_age_ (age in years), _education_ (years of education), _capitalgain_ (amount of capital gains in the last year),\t_capitalloss_ (amount of capital loss in the last year),\t_hoursweek_ (hours per week worked), _salaryclass_ (whether an individual makes more then $50k annually).\n",

    "### Part B. \n",
    "Using the data in [<https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mschuck1/classes/DTSC2301/Data/credit_card_defaults.csv>], create the best classification model based for predicting whether or not an individual will default on their next months payment: _default payment next month_ == 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce the data to your audience in a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a single paragraph report on your model and briefly describe other models you considered and your process for selecting a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In a paragraph, give a description of the model that you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables in these data are: \n",
    "_limit_ is Amount of the given credit (dollars), _gender_ (1 = male; 2 = female), *education_level* (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others), *marital_status* (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others), _age_ ( in years), \n",

    "*pay_0* is repayment in previous month, *pay_2* is repayment two months ago, *pay_3* is repayment status three months ago, ....  \n",
    "These features/variables take the values: -1 is paid on time, 1 is payment delayed by one month, 2 is payment delayed by two months, …, 9 is payment delayed for nine months or more. \n",

    "*bill_amt1* is amount of current bill statement, *bill_amt2* is the bill statement for the previous month, *bill_amt3* is the bill statement for two months ago, …. *bill_amt6* is the bill statement for five months ago.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Part C.\n",
    "For this part, you will read about and analyze data related to the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger.  Start by watching this video: [<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JOjcDFtBE>].\n",

    "Analyze the data found in [<https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mschuck1/classes/DTSC2301/Data/orings.csv>] by making a logistic regression predicting the chance of O-ring damage given air temperature.  Predict the probability that an o-ring would fail at 50 degrees, at 40 degrees and at 30 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a summary of your model and your predictions.  Generate a graph with the predicted logistic regression curve, label it and refer to it in your summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following questions, write two or three paragraph response to each prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From an ethical perspective, what does the phrase “data scientists should never surrender their professional judgment to organizational pressure” mean to you? Can you think of consequences when this principle is violated?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What ethical issues arise from asking data scientists to ``prove the launch is safe`` rather than ``prove it is unsafe``? How does this relate to confirmation bias and responsibility in risk communication?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How reliable or “proven” should technology be before it’s used in high-risk missions like spaceflight? What ethical considerations guide that threshold?\n",

    "### Part D.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the group project from DTSC 2302, you will complete a form evaluating your groupmates.  Failure to complete the form will result in your receiving half credit or less for this part of the project.   \n",
