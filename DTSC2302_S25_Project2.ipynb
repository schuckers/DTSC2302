    "For this assignment, you’ll work in groups of approximately four.  You’ll turn in this assignment via Gradescope.  You may NOT use generative AI for this project.  When you submit your report, start each Part on a new page.  For each of the parts below, support your answers with evidence.  Your audience is a statistically knowledge boss who understands modelling broadly but is busy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis you will write a proposal, a report and record a presentation which will focus on the implications of the model with a small amount of emphasis on the modelling process.   Be sure to specify any new features you created.  Put supportive model output in an Appendix for each Part below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Data Sources\n",
    "Here are the possible datasets you can use for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "[New York City Open Data:](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Charlotte Area Open Data:](https://data.charlottenc.gov/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Charlotte Area Quality of Life Data:](https://mcmap.org/qol/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[State of North Carolina:(Requires free registation)](https://linc.osbm.nc.gov/pages/home/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Possible Data Sources above you will select data and build two models, one a \n",
    "regression model and one a classification model, using the sources above.  The models\n",
    "should be on the same theme, e.g. transportation or education.  You are\n",
    "very likely going to need to merge data from 2 or more pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "For each model (classification and regression) you are building you need to start with at least five features for each model.  You will need to consider at least three different methods (GAMs, kNNs, etc.) for modelling your data.  You should go through and document your model building process.  Models should be assessed and descriptions of important predictors should be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the breakdown of the grading for this project.  Doing just the basics will get you approximately an 85%, so please go ahead and do extras to impress us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Proposal on topics you will study due to Gradescope by *23 April 11:59 pm*.  This proposal should include the topic you have chosen, (e.g.Education or Transportation), include the target variables and the features you will use for both models.  It should be in the form of a short memo to your boss.  [20 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduction: Descibe the topic you chose, why it was of interest and mention the results.  Tell your reader what is to follow in the rest of your report. [15 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regression Model: Report on your regression model including discussion of approach that led to a final model. Include an assessment of how well the model performed [25 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Classification Model: Report on your classification model including discussion of approach that led to a final model.  Include an assessment of how well the model performed [25 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conclusion: Recap what you did for your audience and summarize the conclusions [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluation from Groupmates [30 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Recorded an AT MOST 3 minute presentation as an MP4 file along the lines of (https://gradlife.charlotte.edu/wellness/three-minute-thesis/).  You'll need to record a video and upload it to Gradescope [15 pts] \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Code uploaded as Appendix. [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments (based upon student questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your topic can be any that makes sense to you.  Transportation and Education above so you can use them but you don't need to.  Be creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your proposal should be at most 1 (ONE) page in length.  There is now a Gradescope portal for the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do not worry about the performance of your models reaching some threshold; instead, try to make the best possible model that you can.  Be sure to show you steps toward your final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You are not allowed to use late passes on this assignment."
